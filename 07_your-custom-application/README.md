Implement your own servlet, solving some simple problem. Use all you have learned so far.
You can use branch `solution` and fully implemented `animal-servlet`
Here is some ideas, if you don't have clue, what to build:

#### 1. A weight tracker app
  > * It accepts a set of manual entries of weight measurements taken at different dates
  > * It can plot a graph
  > * It can allow you to track multiple entities, for example more than one person’s weight
  > * It stores the weights somewhere

#### 2. A calculator app
> * A standard calculator: numbers, +, -, *, /, and the result

#### 3. A book database
> * Enter the books you own
> * Enter the books you’d like to buy
> * Store the book info and images

#### 4. A recipes app
> * Enter a name and a description with the steps
> * Have pictures
> * Have some ranking for difficulty and quality
> * Add the time needed
> * Have different steps with a picture for each
> * Store them somewhere

#### 5. A bill tracker
> * Log bills, amounts, and dates
> * List bills
> * Have a few graphs (this year / last year)
> * Store them somewhere

#### 6. An expenses tracker
> * Log expenses and tag them (or have categories)
> * List expenses
> * Have a few graphs (last month / last year)

#### 10. A pomodoro app
> * Enter a time

> * Store the history

#### 12. Tic-tac-toe game
> * We all know what a tic-tac-toe game is 🙂

> * A great project involving math and graphics.

#### 14. A blog engine

#### 15. A QA engine

Think Intercom or Olark.
