# 07_your-custom-application
Implement your own servlet, solving some simple problem. Use all you have learned so far.
You can use branch `solution` and fully implemented `animal-servlet`
Here is some ideas, if you don't have clue, what to build:

#### 1. A weight tracker app
  > * It accepts a set of manual entries of weight measurements taken at different dates
  > * It can plot a graph
  > * It can allow you to track multiple entities, for example more than one person’s weight
  > * It stores the weights somewhere

#### 2. A calculator app
> * A standard calculator: numbers, +, -, *, /, and the result

#### 3. A book database
> * Enter the books you own
> * Enter the books you’d like to buy
> * Store the book info and images

#### A recipes app
> * Enter a name and a description with the steps
> * Have pictures
> * Have some ranking for difficulty and quality
> * Add the time needed
> * Have different steps with a picture for each
> * Store them somewhere

#### A bill tracker
> * Log bills, amounts, and dates
> * List bills
> * Have a few graphs (this year / last year)
> * Store them somewhere

#### An expenses tracker
> * Log expenses and tag them (or have categories)
> * List expenses
> * Have a few graphs (last month / last year)
> * Store them somewhere

#### A chat application
> * Some sort of stripped-down Slack
> * People enter without authentication and are assigned a name, stored for when they come back
> * Store the history
> * Add notifications

#### A notes app
> * Add a new note
> * List all your notes in the sidebar
> * Store them somewhere

#### A personal diary app

#### A pomodoro app
> * Enter a time
> * Start timer

#### A meme generator
> * Have 10 popular meme images
> * Let the user add the text
> * Result is image + text
> * Store the history

#### Tic-tac-toe game
> * We all know what a tic-tac-toe game is 🙂

#### The game of life
> * A great project involving math and graphics.

#### A blog engine
> * Allow user to login and add posts
> * Visitors can add comments
> * Store the data somewhere

#### A QA engine
> * Allow user to login
> * Add questions
> * Answer to questions
> * Allow original user to choose the best question
> * Store the data somewhere

#### A forum engine
> * Allow user to login
> * Add posts

#### An embeddable live chat
Think Intercom or Olark.

> * Have a “backend” where you respond
> * Embed on a web page
